# AlgoArt
Algorithmic Art is a creative blend of programming, design, and the arts. This project uses computer algorithms to process images and create compelling art. The two main algorithms incorporated in the project are Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree and Nearest-Neighbors along with 2-Opt Travelling Salesman Heuristic.

Programmed in MATLAB.

Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree:
A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted (un)directed graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.

Nearest-Neighbors Travelling Salesman Heuristic:
A famous problem in Computer Science, travelling salesman problem (TSP) essentially asks: given a set of points, commonly defined as cities on a map, find the shortest route that covers all the points exactly once. Many algorithms have been proposed as solutions to the TSP, two of which this project covers are the nearest neighbor and 2-Opt heuristics.
